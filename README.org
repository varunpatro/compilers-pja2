This package aims to provide basic code so that students can work on the 
second project assignment, which is to turn the jlite programs to intermediate
codes written in the intermdiate representation called "IR3".  

The package contains Ocaml codes that handles the lexer and parser 
for jLite programs

The main program for this package is 
		jlite_main.ml

It makes use of the data structure file "jlite_structs.ml" to construct
parse trees. 

Students are required to develop code that performs two things:
1. perform semantics analysis on the parse trees to ensure that the jlite programs
meet the semantics requirements. 
2. perform intermediate code generation to produce IR3 codes. 

In order to have standardize three address code format, the structure of the
3-address code is defined in the file "ir3_structs.ml". 

There are some test cases available in the directory "Tests". 

If we runs jlite_main program against these test cases, one will get the
parsing results printed.
