There are naming conflicts between the programs provided and the parser that's implemented.

To prevent any ambiguity, here are the standards I followed:

1. The =void= keyword has to be lower case. The upper case =Void= is a custom type.
2. The =NULL= keyword has to be all upper case.
3. To compile the code, run ~make -B~
4. To output the IR3 representation, run ~./jlite_main Tests/simple.j~
5. Compare the output of the program with the output in the =out= folder.
